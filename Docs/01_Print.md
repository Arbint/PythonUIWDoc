# Print

* The ```print``` function can be used to print out mesage to the console:
```py   
print("Hello")
```
will print out:
```sh
> Hello
```
* You can also print out [variables](../Docs/03_Variables.md):

```py
age = 15
print(age)
```
this will print out:
```sh
> 15
```

* you can use formatted string to combine variables and string literals:

```py
name = "bob"
age = 12
print(f"{name} is {age} years old")
```
this will print out:
```sh
> bob is 12 years old
```
