# Statement

a statement is one step of instruction:
```py
print("Hello!") # this is a statement
```
usually, each line is considered a statement:
```py
print("Hello!") # this is one statement
print("How are you?") # this is another statement
```
the program runs statements one after the other.
```py
print("Hello!") # this statement runs first
print("How are you?") # this statement runs after
```
the above code outputs:
```sh
> hello!
> How are you?
```
If you want to put multiple statement in one line, add a ```;``` between each statements.

```py
print("Hello");print("How Are You!");print("Have a nice day!")
```
